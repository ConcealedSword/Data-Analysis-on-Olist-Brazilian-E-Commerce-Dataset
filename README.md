# Data-Analysis-on-Olist-Brazilian-E-Commerce-Dataset
In this repository, I have conducted data analysis on the Olist dataset to gain more insights about the data for customer retention and market performance.

The dataset consists of 9 tables about the orders made at the Olist store. The dataset contains information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. The data is real commercial data, which has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners have been replaced with the names of Games of Thrones great houses. More information about the dataset can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the market performance and provide tips to stores to increase customer retention. I have created a document documenting my findings together with a jupyter notebbook file containing my codes. The document name is 'Data Analysis on Olist Dataset' and the jupyter notebook file is named 'Olist Project Python'
